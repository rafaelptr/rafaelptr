### Hi, I&#39m Rafael Petronilio ðŸ‘‹

I&#39;m a software engineer with 9 years of experience, 6 of which in credit recovery projects in the financial
market. In these projects, I worked on modernizing, transforming and redesigning processes with different
technologies and programming languages, such as .NET, Java, Python, Cobol, AWS, etc. Some of the results I
achieved were: reducing operating costs, increasing efficiency and quality, also improving customer experience
and data security by implementing new features and protocols. Currently, I&#39;m working on projects to transform
the credit recovery strategy engine, modernizing mainframe Cobol processes for new processes, tools and
applications using Java and Python on AWS and messaging queues. I&#39;m a motivated and dedicated professional,
always looking to do my best and learn new things. I find it easy to work in a team and with agile methodology,
solve problems and adapt to changes and new technologies.
My proficiency in 9 years are: 4 years Java Spring Boot, 3 years with Python, .NET and Cobol/JCL Batch.
