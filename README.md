### Hi, I'm Rafael Petronilio ðŸ‘‹

I&#39;m a software engineer with 11 years of experience, I worked on modernizing, transforming and redesigning processes with different
technologies and programming languages, such as .NET, Java, Python, Cobol, AWS, etc.   
Focusing on reducing operating costs, increasing efficiency and quality, also improving customer experience and data security by implementing new features and protocols.   
Currently, I&#39;m Full Stack developer at a large financial company transforming and modernizing applications.   
Developing backend at most Java and Python, frontend in Angular, all those deployed on AWS using terraform.   
I&#39;m a motivated and dedicated professional, always looking to do my best and learn new things.   
I find it easy to work in a team and with agile methodology, solve problems and adapt to changes and new technologies.
